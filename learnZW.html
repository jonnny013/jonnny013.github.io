        <p>歡迎光臨(huān yíng guāng lín)Welcome to the wonderful world of Chinese! Here you will find some tips to get you started, and some resources to find your own way.</p>
        <p>Before we get started, I would like to talk about self-learning in general. The most important things you will need is motivation and consistency. In order to accomplish self-learning goals, you need to find a reason to work hard, and you need to remember that none of it will be easy.</p>
        <p> The next thing you need to do is be consistent. It may come from making a schedule, finding a study buddy to push you or making studies your entire day each day.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consistency</li>
            <li>Motivation</li>
          </ul>
        
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Introduction_to_Chinese">
        <header>Introduction to Chinese</header>
        <p>The biggest piece of advice I can give you early on is to forget everything you know when you start learning. Stop comparing sounds, sentence patterns and grammar to your own language. This will ruin you and take away your ability to learn it naturally. When you do have a solid foundation, using your native language to have certain concepts will come in handy, but not at the beginning. You must start with an empty mind before doing anything.</p>
        <p>A lot of people will tell you that learning the characters is not neccesary. I completely disagree. You should know exactly which characters you are using so that you can build on those words to form new ideas and sentences with them. It also makes it easier to remember each word and you have a lot more opportunities to learn when you read.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Empty your mind and forget what you know</li>
            <li>Learn to read the characters</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Starting_Point">
        <header>Starting Point</header>
        <p>Learning a new language can be overwhelming, so I recommend using an app like Rosetta Stone or Duo Lingo to start.</p> <p>Once you have some words and sentence structures down, start reading.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apps: <a class="outside-links" href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duo Lingo</a> or <a class="outside-links" href="https://www.rosettastone.com">Rosetta Stone</a></li>

        <header>Self Motivation</header>
        <p>This will be the toughest part of self-learning. You need to find the right motivation. Some potential motivaters could be a trip to a place that speaks Chinese, passing a language test, changing careers, etc. For me, it was a pretty girl that only spoke Chinese and I really wanted to be more than friends so I worked hard to make that happen.</p>
        <p>Wanting to learn "just because you are interested" will make it very difficult to get anywhere. Everything else will take priority when you are busy or lazy. So until you find the right motivation to break that chain, you will struggle to make it happen.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Find your true motivater</li>
            <li>Don't do it only for interest</li>
          </ul>

        <header>Moving Forward</header>
        <p>So you've learned how to introduce yourself, buy something at a market and navigate your way around town. These are key components in learning, but what should you do now?</p>
        <p>A big portion of this will go back to your motivation. What direction do you need to go? If your motivation doesn't specify a path, not to worry! You can choose an area of interest and start reading articles in that subject. It will be daunting at first, but if you stick to it, your level will skyrocket in a short period of time. Remember to take notes when finding new words and sentence patterns.</p>
        <p>The next, and probably most important thing you should do is find a new friend, and start that friendship in Chinese. It is easy to lose focus when you start a friendship in your native language, even if that person speaks Chinese. The more friends you have that speak Chinese, the faster your listening skills will improve. When I first started hanging out in groups of Chinese speakers, I struggled to keep up, but before long I was able to keep up and give my own input, too.</p>
        <p>The last bit about hanging out in groups leads me to my next point, you need to drop your ego and admit that you don't understand something and ask for help or an explanation on the subject at hand. Adjectives will always be useful in this sort of situation, so never stop learning new words</p>
        <p>My last recommendation for further learning is KTV (karaoke). Find out from your friends which songs are popular (or use youtube searches) and choose one or two songs to start, learn the lyrics, sing them and know it by heart if you can. Then choose more songs and repeat.</p>
          <ul>

        <header>Making Goals</header>
        <p>Similar to motivation, we need goals. Making clear goals with timelines will help push you to your next step. You should also set rewards and punishment for your goals.  An example could look like these:</p>
        <p>Memorize Student Book lesson 5's vocabulary by the end of the week. If succesful: Eat 豆花. If unsuccesful: Three days of Chinese programs and music, no English TV or music during that time.</p>
        <p>Learn all the words from the chorus of 周杰倫's song within 3 days. Reward: KTV night with friends. Punishment: Night at home filled with Chinese reading. 
          <ul>
            <li>Goals help motivate</li>
            <li>Give clear timelines with rewards and punishment</li>
          </ul>

        <p>At a certain point, you will need outside help. It is simply not possible to fluently learn an entire language by yourself, and asking friends for help can only get you so far before you don't have any friends. So my advice here is to make a choice: find a person that wants to exchange languages or hire a tutor. I don't recommend finding a language exchange partner really early on because it is more than likely you will get used for your language and won't get a lot in return. Paying for tutors can get pricey if they are good, and you could be wasting a lot of money if they aren't. Tones and certain patterns are almost impossible to do on your own, you will need someone to help correct your mistakes and fix them. You should also prepare a list of questions about vocab or misunderstandings that happened throughout the week before meeting someone to help you.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Find a language exchange partner</li>
            <li>Hire a tutor</li>
          </ul>

        <header>Turning Learning Into Using</header>
        <p>At a certain point, you need to realized that having a friend that speaks Chinese isn't just for you to learn Chinese, you are actually friends now! When you can keep up in a group conversation, and get deep in a one on one conversation, you are no longer practicing. Remember to tell yourself how far you've come and just enjoy those moments. Don't stop learning, but remember when to enjoy your surroundings without pressure.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Admit that you've done it</li>
            <li>Enjoy yourself</li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="More_Than_Language">
        <header>More Than Language</header>
        <p>So here is one huge factor when learning Chinese that you need to keep in mind: you need to fully understand the culture to fully understand the language. You don't have to make it yours or accept every part of it, but you definitely need to understand it. Certain things like food that we don't have in western countries and don't have proper English names, you'll need to know those. Certain ideas don't translate in a word or two and without background, you won't be able to understand what something means. A quick example that comes to my mind is 孝順(xiào shùn). At a glance, this translates to "devoted to one's parents". What does that actually mean? In short (and my own quick translation), you need to take care of your parents and respect them in a way similar to the respect you give to a god.  It's not something we do in western culture for the most part, so without understanding what the children do for their parents, you would not be able to understand this vocabulary word.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn the culture</li>
            <li>Eat the food</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Learning by yourself is an uphill battle, but from my own experience, you will come out better than most students that have taken Chinese courses in the best universities in Chinese speaking places. You must learn like a baby learns a new language to be the best at it.</p>
